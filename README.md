# Sudo random number generator

Majic 8 ball program using C++ and Aembly language for intel x86 processors. 
Program won't work anymore since
1. I couldn't find the audio files
2. It uses an older version of Visual Studio
3. It uses an External Library that I couldn't find

It is still fun to look at code and read what I did to make this program
